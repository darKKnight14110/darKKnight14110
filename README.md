## Machine Learning Projects

### [CP/DSA Solver](https://github.com/arnavjain2710/IITISoC24-ML-35)
- Implemented Retrieval Augmented Generation using FAISS Similarity Search on Embeddings of scrapped dataset
- Conducted RL-based ORPO finetuning on DeepSeek-AI-Coder LLM on Github API-scrapped CP dataset
- Utilized LLM with RAG for code generation & explanation solving hard DSA questions & 1200-rated CP questions

### [Game Character Skin Generation](https://github.com/darKKnight14110/Game-Character-Skin-Generation)
â€“ Built an AI-driven system for custom skins generation for Clash of Clans using Stable Diffusion and ControlNets
â€“ Implemented finetuning on CompVis-v1-4 model on custom dataset for 200 steps for precise style adaptation
â€“ Integrated the finetuned sd model with lllyasviel control-v11p-inpaint for accurate prompt to image generation
â€¢ Gesture Identification using EMG-data Jan. 2024 - Feb. 2024

### [Deep Learning & Signal Processing](https://github.com/darKKnight14110/EMG_data)
â€“ Employed the NinaPro DB5 dataset with 53 diverse gestures from MYO armbands,ensuring thorough preprocessing.
â€“ Used various signal processing techniques including rectification, filtering, and smoothing on raw EMG data
â€“ Engineered an 86% accurate attention-based model leveraging expansion, attention, and classification layers.
